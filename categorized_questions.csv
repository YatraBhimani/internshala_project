65,What are the three basic components of connective tissues ?,"**Explanation:**

Connective tissues are a type of tissue that connects, supports, and protects other tissues and organs in the body. They are composed of three basic components:

1. **Cells:** Connective tissues contain specialized cells called fibroblasts, which are responsible for producing and secreting the protein fibers and ground substance.

2. **Protein fibers:** These fibers provide strength and support to the connective tissue. The most common types of protein fibers are collagen, elastin, and reticular fibers.

3. **Ground substance:** The ground substance is a gel-like substance that fills the space between the cells and protein fibers. It contains a variety of proteins, proteoglycans, and glycosaminoglycans that provide hydration, support, and protection to the tissue.

Each type of connective tissue has a different combination and arrangement of these three components to suit its specific function. For example, tendons, which connect muscles to bones, have a high proportion of collagen fibers for strength and flexibility, while cartilage, which lines the joints, has a high proportion of ground substance for lubrication and shock absorption.

**Additional context:**

* Connective tissues are classified into six main types based on their structure and function: loose connective tissue, dense connective tissue, cartilage, bone, blood, and lymph.
* Connective tissues are found throughout the body, providing support for organs, cushioning joints, protecting against infection, and transporting nutrients and oxygen.

Simple epithelium is a thin layer of cells that covers the surface of the body or lines the cavities of internal organs. It is composed of a single layer of cells that are closely packed together. Simple epithelium is not vascularized, meaning it does not contain blood vessels. This is because the cells of simple epithelium are so thin that they can receive nutrients and oxygen from the underlying connective tissue by diffusion.

Vascularization is the process of supplying blood to a tissue or organ. It is essential for providing nutrients and oxygen to the cells of the tissue or organ. Simple epithelium does not require vascularization because its cells are so thin that they can receive nutrients and oxygen from the underlying connective tissue by diffusion.

Simple epithelium is a thin layer of cells that covers the surface of the body or lines the cavities of internal organs. It is composed of a single layer of cells that are closely packed together. Simple epithelium is not vascularized, meaning it does not contain blood vessels. This is because the cells of simple epithelium are so thin that they can receive nutrients and oxygen from the underlying connective tissue by diffusion.

Vascularization is the process of supplying blood to a tissue or organ. It is essential for providing nutrients and oxygen to the cells of the tissue or organ. Simple epithelium does not require vascularization because its cells are so thin that they can receive nutrients and oxygen from the underlying connective tissue by diffusion.

The other statements about simple epithelium are correct. Simple epithelium is avascular, meaning it does not contain blood vessels. It is composed of a single layer of cells that are closely packed together. Simple epithelium is found in a variety of locations in the body, including the lining of the blood vessels, the lining of the digestive tract, and the lining of the respiratory tract.",medium

325,Matrix of cartilage is produced by :,"**Matrix of cartilage is produced by: Chondroblasts**

**Explanation:**

Cartilage is a type of connective tissue that provides support and flexibility to various body structures. It consists of specialized cells called chondrocytes that are embedded in a matrix composed of collagen fibers, proteoglycans, and water.

**Chondroblasts are immature cartilage cells responsible for synthesizing and secreting the matrix.** They are derived from mesenchymal stem cells and differentiate into chondrocytes once they are enclosed within the matrix.

During the development and growth of cartilage, chondroblasts actively produce and secrete components of the matrix, including collagen fibers, proteoglycans, and other glycosaminoglycans. These molecules form a complex interwoven network that provides the characteristic strength and flexibility of cartilage.

The matrix of cartilage is highly hydrated, containing up to 80% water, which contributes to its resilience and shock-absorbing properties. The collagen fibers provide tensile strength, while proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans bind to water, creating a gel-like substance that allows for compression and flexibility.

Chondrocytes, once embedded within the matrix, maintain the integrity of the cartilage by producing and secreting additional matrix components as needed. They also regulate the turnover and degradation of the matrix through enzymes such as metalloproteinases.

**Other important points related to cartilage matrix production:**

* The process of cartilage matrix production is called chondrogenesis.
* The composition and properties of the matrix can vary depending on the type of cartilage (hyaline, elastic, or fibrocartilage).
* Chondroblasts are often found in clusters called chondrogenic zones or nests.
* Once chondroblasts differentiate into chondrocytes, they become trapped within the matrix and lose their ability to divide.

Cartilage is a type of connective tissue that provides support and flexibility to various body structures. It consists of specialized cells called chondrocytes that are embedded in a matrix composed of collagen fibers, proteoglycans, and water.

**Chondroblasts are immature cartilage cells responsible for synthesizing and secreting the matrix.** They are derived from mesenchymal stem cells and differentiate into chondrocytes once they are enclosed within the matrix.

During the development and growth of cartilage, chondroblasts actively produce and secrete components of the matrix, including collagen fibers, proteoglycans, and other glycosaminoglycans. These molecules form a complex interwoven network that provides the characteristic strength and flexibility of cartilage.

The matrix of cartilage is highly hydrated, containing up to 80% water, which contributes to its resilience and shock-absorbing properties. The collagen fibers provide tensile strength, while proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans bind to water, creating a gel-like substance that allows for compression and flexibility.

Chondrocytes, once embedded within the matrix, maintain the integrity of the cartilage by producing and secreting additional matrix components as needed. They also regulate the turnover and degradation of the matrix through enzymes such as metalloproteinases.

**Other important points related to cartilage matrix production:**

* The process of cartilage matrix production is called chondrogenesis.
* The composition and properties of the matrix can vary depending on the type of cartilage (hyaline, elastic, or fibrocartilage).
* Chondroblasts are often found in clusters called chondrogenic zones or nests.
* Once chondroblasts differentiate into chondrocytes, they become trapped within the matrix and lose their ability to divide.
* Cartilage is avascular, meaning it lacks blood vessels, which limits its ability to repair and regenerate.",hard
329,Which of following lacks blood supply ?,"**Explanation:**

Cartilage is a type of connective tissue that is found in various parts of the body, such as the joints, ears, and nose. Unlike other tissues, cartilage does not have a blood supply. Instead, it relies on the diffusion of nutrients from the surrounding tissues.

The lack of blood supply in cartilage is due to its unique structure. Cartilage is composed of cells called chondrocytes, which are embedded in a matrix of collagen and proteoglycans. This matrix is very dense and prevents blood vessels from penetrating the tissue.

The lack of blood supply has several implications for cartilage. First, it means that cartilage is very slow to heal. If cartilage is damaged, it can take a long time for it to repair itself. Second, the lack of blood supply makes cartilage susceptible to infection. Bacteria and other microorganisms cannot easily reach cartilage, but if they do, they can cause serious infections that are difficult to treat.

**Additional context:**

Cartilage is divided into three main types:

* **Hyaline cartilage** is the most common type of cartilage. It is found in the joints, the ribs, and the nose.
* **Elastic cartilage** is found in the ears and the epiglottis. It is more flexible than hyaline cartilage.
* **Fibrocartilage** is the strongest type of cartilage. It is found in the intervertebral discs and the menisci of the knees.

Cartilage is a very important tissue in the body. It provides support, cushioning, and flexibility. The lack of blood supply in cartilage is a unique feature that has both advantages and disadvantages.",hard

357,What will happen if ligaments are cut or broken ?,"**Explanation**

Ligaments are tough, fibrous connective tissues that connect bones to other bones. They are responsible for providing stability and preventing excessive movement at joints.

If ligaments are cut or broken, the bones they connect will become unfixed. This can lead to instability, pain, and decreased range of motion at the affected joint.

In severe cases, a torn ligament can lead to dislocation of the bones, which is a complete separation of the bones at a joint. This can be a very serious injury that requires immediate medical attention.

Therefore, it is important to protect ligaments from injury by avoiding activities that could put them at risk, such as contact sports or heavy lifting. If you do experience a ligament injury, it is important to see a doctor to get it diagnosed and treated properly.

369,Cartilage is formed by :,"**Answer: Chondroblasts**

**Explanation:**

Cartilage is a type of connective tissue that is found in many parts of the body, including the joints, ears, and nose. It is composed of cells called chondroblasts, which are responsible for producing the cartilage matrix. The matrix is made up of collagen fibers and proteoglycans, which give cartilage its strength and flexibility.

Chondroblasts are found in the inner layer of the perichondrium, which is a membrane that surrounds cartilage. When a chondroblast produces enough matrix, it becomes trapped within the matrix and is called a chondrocyte. Chondrocytes are mature cartilage cells that are responsible for maintaining the cartilage matrix.

There are three types of cartilage: hyaline cartilage, elastic cartilage, and fibrocartilage. Hyaline cartilage is the most common type of cartilage and is found in the joints, ribs, and trachea. Elastic cartilage is found in the ears and epiglottis and is more flexible than hyaline cartilage. Fibrocartilage is found in the intervertebral discs and knee menisci and is stronger than hyaline cartilage.

**Bone marrow** is a soft, spongy tissue found inside the cavities of bones. It is responsible for the production of blood cells, a process known as **haematopoiesis.**

* **Red bone marrow:** Produces red blood cells (erythrocytes), white blood cells (leukocytes), and platelets (thrombocytes).
* **Yellow bone marrow:** Primarily composed of fat cells. However, it can convert back to red bone marrow in times of increased blood cell demand (e.g., during recovery from blood loss).

**Role of bone marrow in haematopoiesis:**

* Stem cells in the bone marrow differentiate into **haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs).**
* HSCs give rise to **common myeloid progenitors (CMPs)** and **common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs).**
* CMPs develop into erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets.
* CLPs mature into lymphocytes (B cells, T cells, and natural killer cells).

401,"Which one of the following muscles, gets fatigued very quickly?","**Explanation:**

Skeletal muscles are voluntary muscles that are attached to the bones. They are used for conscious movements, such as walking, running, and lifting objects. 

Skeletal muscles fatigue quickly because they contain a high proportion of fast-twitch muscle fibers. 

Fast-twitch muscle fibers are primarily responsible for rapid but powerful contractions and rely on anaerobic metabolism, which produces energy quickly but also leads to the accumulation of lactic acid as a byproduct. 

As lactic acid accumulates, it lowers the muscle's pH and interferes with its ability to contract, leading to fatigue.

In contrast, slow-twitch muscle fibers, which are found in endurance muscles, have a higher capacity for aerobic metabolism and can sustain contractions for longer periods without fatigue.

417,Which cell-organelle is absent in neurons ?,"**Answer: Centriole**

**Explanation:**

Centrioles are cylindrical structures that help in organizing microtubules for the formation of cilia and flagella. They are present in almost all eukaryotic cells, except for mature red blood cells and neural cells like neurons.

In neurons, the absence of centrioles is related to their unique function and structure. Neurons are primarily responsible for transmitting electrical impulses, and their shape and structure are optimized for this purpose. The presence of centrioles, which are involved in cell division, would not be beneficial for neurons as they do not undergo cell division once they mature.

The absence of centrioles in neurons is a specialized adaptation that allows them to maintain their structure and function effectively throughout their lifespan.",medium

461,A muscle fibre tapers at ends and does not show striations is :,"**Explanation:**

Muscle fibres are long, cylindrical cells that make up muscles. They are responsible for the contraction and relaxation of muscles, which allows for movement.

There are three types of muscle fibres: skeletal muscle fibres, cardiac muscle fibres, and smooth muscle fibres.

* **Skeletal muscle fibres** are attached to bones and are responsible for voluntary movements, such as walking, running, and jumping. They are long, cylindrical cells with striations (bands) that are visible under a microscope.
* **Cardiac muscle fibres** are found in the heart and are responsible for the pumping action of the heart. They are also long, cylindrical cells with striations, but they are shorter and thicker than skeletal muscle fibres.
* **Smooth muscle fibres** are found in the walls of hollow organs, such as the stomach, intestines, and blood vessels. They are not attached to bones and are responsible for involuntary movements, such as digestion and blood flow. They are shorter and thinner than skeletal muscle fibres and do not have striations.

**Therefore, the muscle fibre that tapers at ends and does not show striations is a smooth muscle fibre.**

**Additional context:**

Muscle fibres are composed of myofibrils, which are bundles of myofilaments. Myofilaments are made up of two proteins: actin and myosin. When a muscle fibre contracts, the myosin filaments slide over the actin filaments, causing the muscle to shorten.

The striations in skeletal and cardiac muscle fibres are caused by the arrangement of the actin and myosin filaments. In skeletal muscle fibres, the actin and myosin filaments are arranged in a regular pattern, which creates the striated appearance. In cardiac muscle fibres, the actin and myosin filaments are arranged in a less regular pattern, which creates a less distinct striated appearance.

Smooth muscle fibres do not have striations because the actin and myosin filaments are not arranged in a regular pattern.",medium

**Reason:**
Ligaments are connective tissues that connect bones to other bones. They are made of collagen and elastin fibers and are therefore flexible but strong. Tendons, on the other hand, are connective tissues that connect muscles to bones. They are made of collagen fibers and are therefore strong and inflexible. Fascia is a layer of connective tissue that surrounds muscles, tendons, and ligaments. It helps to hold these structures in place and provides support. Cartilage is a type of connective tissue that is found in the joints and between the vertebrae. It is made of chondrocytes and collagen fibers and is therefore flexible and shock-absorbing.

489,Many years old 'mummies' still have their arteries intact due to well preserved :,"**Explanation:**

Mummies are preserved bodies that have been embalmed to prevent decomposition. Over time, most of the body's tissues break down, including the blood vessels. However, the arteries of many mummies remain intact due to the presence of well preserved elastic fibres.

Elastic fibres are a type of connective tissue that is highly flexible and elastic. They are found in the walls of arteries and help to prevent them from collapsing when blood pressure drops. In mummies, the elastic fibres have been preserved due to the embalming process, which involved the use of chemicals that prevent the breakdown of tissues. As a result, the arteries of mummies remain intact even though the rest of the body has decomposed.

**Additional context:**

* Elastic fibres are also found in the skin, lungs, and other organs that need to be able to stretch and recoil.
* The embalming process used on mummies typically involved the removal of the internal organs and the injection of preservatives into the body.
