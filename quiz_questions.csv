Connective tissues are a type of tissue that connects, supports, and protects other tissues and organs in the body. They are composed of three basic components:

1. **Cells:** Connective tissues contain specialized cells called fibroblasts, which are responsible for producing and secreting the protein fibers and ground substance.

2. **Protein fibers:** These fibers provide strength and support to the connective tissue. The most common types of protein fibers are collagen, elastin, and reticular fibers.

3. **Ground substance:** The ground substance is a gel-like substance that fills the space between the cells and protein fibers. It contains a variety of proteins, proteoglycans, and glycosaminoglycans that provide hydration, support, and protection to the tissue.

Each type of connective tissue has a different combination and arrangement of these three components to suit its specific function.

**Explanation:**

The supportive skeletal structures in the human external ears and in the nose tip are examples of cartilage. Cartilage is a type of connective tissue that is found throughout the body. It is composed of specialized cells called chondrocytes, which are embedded in a matrix of collagen and other proteins.

Cartilage is a strong and flexible tissue that provides support and protection to the body. It is also found in the joints, where it helps to reduce friction and wear. Cartilage is not as hard as bone, but it is more flexible and elastic. This makes it ideal for use in areas where flexibility is important.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the role of cartilage in the human external ears and nose tip:

* **External ears:** The external ears are made up of a thin layer of skin that is supported by a framework of cartilage. This cartilage gives the external ears their shape and allows them to move.
* **Nose tip:** The nose tip is also made up of a thin layer of skin that is supported by a framework of cartilage. This cartilage gives the nose tip its shape and allows it to move.

Cartilage is an important tissue that plays a vital role in the structure and function of the human body. It is a strong and flexible tissue that provides support, protection, and flexibility.

They are associated with **areolar connective tissue**, which is a loose, irregularly arranged type of connective tissue that is found in many parts of the body, such as the dermis of the skin and the submucosa of the digestive tract. Mast cells are important for the body's immune response, as they release histamine and other inflammatory mediators when they are activated.

Here are some additional details about mast cells and areolar connective tissue:

* Mast cells are derived from stem cells in the bone marrow. They circulate in the blood and then migrate to tissues where they are needed.
* Areolar connective tissue is a type of loose connective tissue that is characterized by its loose, irregular arrangement of collagen fibers. It is found in many parts of the body, such as the dermis of the skin, the submucosa of the digestive tract, and the stroma of organs.
* Mast cells are activated by a variety of stimuli, including allergens, cytokines, and physical trauma. When they are activated, they release histamine and other inflammatory mediators, which cause blood vessels to dilate and become more permeable. This leads to increased blood flow and the accumulation of fluid and white blood cells in the affected area.
* Mast cells play an important role in the body's immune response. They are involved in both innate immunity and adaptive immunity. In innate immunity, mast cells release histamine and other inflammatory mediators that help to recruit other immune cells to the site of infection. In adaptive immunity, mast cells present antigens to T cells, which helps to activate the adaptive immune response.

1898,Brush border epithelium occurs in :,structural organisation in animals ,"**Explanation:**

The brush border epithelium is a specialized type of epithelium that lines the small intestine. It is characterized by the presence of numerous microvilli, which are small finger-like protrusions. These microvilli increase the surface area of the epithelium, which allows for the efficient absorption of nutrients from the digested food.

The small intestine is the primary site of nutrient absorption in the human body. It is divided into three regions: the duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum. The brush border epithelium is present in all three regions, but it is most prominent in the jejunum and ileum.

The brush border epithelium is composed of a single layer of tall columnar cells. The cells are connected by tight junctions, which prevent the passage of materials between the cells. The apical surface of the cells is covered in microvilli. The microvilli are lined with glycoproteins, which provide a sticky surface for the absorption of nutrients.

The brush border epithelium also contains a number of goblet cells, which secrete mucus. The mucus helps to protect the epithelium from damage by digestive enzymes.

1906,Which of the following is not an endocrine gland ?,structural organisation in animals ,"An endocrine gland is a gland that secretes its products (hormones) directly into the bloodstream rather than through a duct. Hormones are chemical messengers that affect the activity of target cells or organs.

Salivary glands, on the other hand, are exocrine glands that secrete their products (saliva) through ducts. Saliva is a clear liquid that helps to lubricate the mouth and break down food.

Therefore, salivary glands are not endocrine glands because they do not secrete their products directly into the bloodstream.

**Additional context:**

The endocrine system is a network of glands that produce and secrete hormones. Hormones are chemical messengers that travel through the bloodstream to target cells or organs. The endocrine system plays a vital role in regulating many bodily functions, including metabolism, growth, reproduction, and mood.

1913,Haversian canal contain :,structural organisation in animals ,"**Explanation:**

Haversian canals are microscopic channels that run through the compact bone tissue. They contain blood vessels and nerves that supply the osteocytes (bone cells) with nutrients and oxygen, and remove waste products.

**Additional context:**

**Structure of Compact Bone:**

* Compact bone is the dense, hard outer layer of bone that provides strength and support.
* It is made up of repeating units called osteons, which are cylindrical structures arranged parallel to the long axis of the bone.
* Each osteon contains a central Haversian canal surrounded by concentric layers of bone matrix and osteocytes.

**Functions of Haversian Canals:**

* Transport nutrients and oxygen to osteocytes.
* Remove waste products from osteocytes.
* Facilitate bone remodeling, where old bone is broken down and replaced with new bone.

**Clinical Significance:**

* Osteoporosis is a condition where the density of bone decreases, making it more fragile and prone to fractures. This is often caused by a loss of bone mass, which can lead to a narrowing of the Haversian canals and reduced blood flow to osteocytes.",7666,Blood vessels and nerves,TRUE,medium

1918,Matrix of cartilage is produced by :,structural organisation in animals ,"**Matrix of cartilage is produced by: Chondroblasts**

**Explanation:**

Cartilage is a type of connective tissue that provides support and flexibility to various body structures. It consists of specialized cells called chondrocytes that are embedded in a matrix composed of collagen fibers, proteoglycans, and water.

**Chondroblasts are immature cartilage cells responsible for synthesizing and secreting the matrix.** They are derived from mesenchymal stem cells and differentiate into chondrocytes once they are enclosed within the matrix.

During the development and growth of cartilage, chondroblasts actively produce and secrete components of the matrix, including collagen fibers, proteoglycans, and other glycosaminoglycans. These molecules form a complex interwoven network that provides the characteristic strength and flexibility of cartilage.

The matrix of cartilage is highly hydrated, containing up to 80% water, which contributes to its resilience and shock-absorbing properties. The collagen fibers provide tensile strength, while proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans bind to water, creating a gel-like substance that allows for compression and flexibility.

Chondrocytes, once embedded within the matrix, maintain the integrity of the cartilage by producing and secreting additional matrix components as needed. They also regulate the turnover and degradation of the matrix through enzymes such as metalloproteinases.

**Other important points related to cartilage matrix production:**

* The process of cartilage matrix production is called chondrogenesis.
* The composition and properties of the matrix can vary depending on the type of cartilage (hyaline, elastic, or fibrocartilage).
* Chondroblasts are often found in clusters called chondrogenic zones or nests.
* Once chondroblasts differentiate into chondrocytes, they become trapped within the matrix and lose their ability to divide.

Cartilage is a type of connective tissue that is found in various parts of the body, such as the joints, ears, and nose. Unlike other tissues, cartilage does not have a blood supply. Instead, it relies on the diffusion of nutrients from the surrounding tissues.

The lack of blood supply in cartilage is due to its unique structure. Cartilage is composed of cells called chondrocytes, which are embedded in a matrix of collagen and proteoglycans. This matrix is very dense and prevents blood vessels from penetrating the tissue.

The lack of blood supply has several implications for cartilage. First, it means that cartilage is very slow to heal. If cartilage is damaged, it can take a long time for it to repair itself. Second, the lack of blood supply makes cartilage susceptible to infection. Bacteria and other microorganisms cannot easily reach cartilage, but if they do, they can cause serious infections that are difficult to treat.

1919,Which of following lacks blood supply ?,structural organisation in animals ,"**Explanation:**

Cartilage is a type of connective tissue that is found in various parts of the body, such as the joints, ears, and nose. Unlike other tissues, cartilage does not have a blood supply. Instead, it relies on the diffusion of nutrients from the surrounding tissues.

The lack of blood supply in cartilage is due to its unique structure. Cartilage is composed of cells called chondrocytes, which are embedded in a matrix of collagen and proteoglycans. This matrix is very dense and prevents blood vessels from penetrating the tissue.

The lack of blood supply has several implications for cartilage. First, it means that cartilage is very slow to heal. If cartilage is damaged, it can take a long time for it to repair itself. Second, the lack of blood supply makes cartilage susceptible to infection. Bacteria and other microorganisms cannot easily reach cartilage, but if they do, they can cause serious infections that are difficult to treat.

**Additional context:**

Cartilage is divided into three main types:

* **Hyaline cartilage** is the most common type of cartilage. It is found in the joints, the ribs, and the nose.
* **Elastic cartilage** is found in the ears and the epiglottis. It is more flexible than hyaline cartilage.
* **Fibrocartilage** is the strongest type of cartilage. It is found in the intervertebral discs and the menisci of the knees.

1926,What will happen if ligaments are cut or broken ?,structural organisation in animals ,"**Explanation**

Ligaments are tough, fibrous connective tissues that connect bones to other bones. They are responsible for providing stability and preventing excessive movement at joints.

If ligaments are cut or broken, the bones they connect will become unfixed. This can lead to instability, pain, and decreased range of motion at the affected joint.

In severe cases, a torn ligament can lead to dislocation of the bones, which is a complete separation of the bones at a joint. This can be a very serious injury that requires immediate medical attention.

Therefore, it is important to protect ligaments from injury by avoiding activities that could put them at risk, such as contact sports or heavy lifting. If you do experience a ligament injury, it is important to see a doctor to get it diagnosed and treated properly.

**Additional context**
The structural organization of animals is a fundamental concept in biology that refers to the way in which the different parts of an animal's body are organized and arranged. Ligaments are just one type of connective tissue that is found in the body. Other types of connective tissue include tendons, cartilage, and bone. Each type of connective tissue has a specific structure and function.

1926,What will happen if ligaments are cut or broken ?,structural organisation in animals ,"**Explanation**

Ligaments are tough, fibrous connective tissues that connect bones to other bones. They are responsible for providing stability and preventing excessive movement at joints.

If ligaments are cut or broken, the bones they connect will become unfixed. This can lead to instability, pain, and decreased range of motion at the affected joint.

In severe cases, a torn ligament can lead to dislocation of the bones, which is a complete separation of the bones at a joint. This can be a very serious injury that requires immediate medical attention.

Therefore, it is important to protect ligaments from injury by avoiding activities that could put them at risk, such as contact sports or heavy lifting. If you do experience a ligament injury, it is important to see a doctor to get it diagnosed and treated properly.

**Additional context**
The structural organization of animals is a fundamental concept in biology that refers to the way in which the different parts of an animal's body are organized and arranged. Ligaments are just one type of connective tissue that is found in the body. Other types of connective tissue include tendons, cartilage, and bone. Each type of connective tissue has a specific structure and function.

1937,"Which one of the following muscles, gets fatigued very quickly?",structural organisation in animals ,"**Explanation:**

Skeletal muscles are voluntary muscles that are attached to the bones. They are used for conscious movements, such as walking, running, and lifting objects. 

Skeletal muscles fatigue quickly because they contain a high proportion of fast-twitch muscle fibers. 

Fast-twitch muscle fibers are primarily responsible for rapid but powerful contractions and rely on anaerobic metabolism, which produces energy quickly but also leads to the accumulation of lactic acid as a byproduct. 

As lactic acid accumulates, it lowers the muscle's pH and interferes with its ability to contract, leading to fatigue.

In contrast, slow-twitch muscle fibers, which are found in endurance muscles, have a higher capacity for aerobic metabolism and can sustain contractions for longer periods without fatigue.

1941,Which cell-organelle is absent in neurons ?,structural organisation in animals ,"**Answer: Centriole**

**Explanation:**

Centrioles are cylindrical structures that help in organizing microtubules for the formation of cilia and flagella. They are present in almost all eukaryotic cells, except for mature red blood cells and neural cells like neurons.

In neurons, the absence of centrioles is related to their unique function and structure. Neurons are primarily responsible for transmitting electrical impulses, and their shape and structure are optimized for this purpose. The presence of centrioles, which are involved in cell division, would not be beneficial for neurons as they do not undergo cell division once they mature.

The absence of centrioles in neurons is a specialized adaptation that allows them to maintain their structure and function effectively throughout their lifespan.",7778,Mitochondria,FALSE,medium

1952,A muscle fibre tapers at ends and does not show striations is :,structural organisation in animals ,"**Explanation:**

Muscle fibres are long, cylindrical cells that make up muscles. They are responsible for the contraction and relaxation of muscles, which allows for movement.

There are three types of muscle fibres: skeletal muscle fibres, cardiac muscle fibres, and smooth muscle fibres.

* **Skeletal muscle fibres** are attached to bones and are responsible for voluntary movements, such as walking, running, and jumping. They are long, cylindrical cells with striations (bands) that are visible under a microscope.
* **Cardiac muscle fibres** are found in the heart and are responsible for the pumping action of the heart. They are also long, cylindrical cells with striations, but they are shorter and thicker than skeletal muscle fibres.
* **Smooth muscle fibres** are found in the walls of hollow organs, such as the stomach, intestines, and blood vessels. They are not attached to bones and are responsible for involuntary movements, such as digestion and blood flow. They are shorter and thinner than skeletal muscle fibres and do not have striations.

**Therefore, the muscle fibre that tapers at ends and does not show striations is a smooth muscle fibre.**

**Additional context:**

Muscle fibres are composed of myofibrils, which are bundles of myofilaments. Myofilaments are made up of two proteins: actin and myosin. When a muscle fibre contracts, the myosin filaments slide over the actin filaments, causing the muscle to shorten.

The striations in skeletal and cardiac muscle fibres are caused by the arrangement of the actin and myosin filaments. In skeletal muscle fibres, the actin and myosin filaments are arranged in a regular pattern, which creates the striated appearance. In cardiac muscle fibres, the actin and myosin filaments are arranged in a less regular pattern, which creates a less distinct striated appearance.

Cartilage is a type of connective tissue that is found in various parts of the body, including the joints, ears, and nose. Unlike the other options (epithelium, muscle, and nervous tissue), cartilage is not composed of cells that are tightly packed together. Instead, cartilage cells (chondrocytes) are surrounded by a gel-like substance called the matrix. The matrix is composed of collagen fibers, which provide cartilage with its strength and flexibility.

Epithelium, muscle, and nervous tissue are all composed of cells that are tightly packed together. Epithelium is a covering tissue that lines the surfaces of the body, such as the skin and the lining of the digestive tract. Muscle tissue is responsible for movement, and nervous tissue is responsible for transmitting signals throughout the body.

Therefore, cartilage is the odd one out because it is the only option that is not composed of cells that are tightly packed together.

**Reason:**
Ligaments are connective tissues that connect bones to other bones. They are made of collagen and elastin fibers and are therefore flexible but strong. Tendons, on the other hand, are connective tissues that connect muscles to bones. They are made of collagen fibers and are therefore strong and inflexible. Fascia is a layer of connective tissue that surrounds muscles, tendons, and ligaments. It helps to hold these structures in place and provides support.

The matrix of a bone is composed of both inorganic and organic components. The inorganic component, which makes up about 70% of the matrix, is primarily composed of hydroxyapatite crystals. These crystals give bone its strength and hardness. The organic component, which makes up about 30% of the matrix, is composed of collagen fibers. These fibers provide bone with its flexibility and tensile strength.

**Additional Context:**

* Hydroxyapatite crystals are arranged in a lattice structure that gives bone its characteristic strength and hardness.
* Collagen fibers are arranged in a network that gives bone its flexibility and tensile strength.
* The ratio of inorganic to organic components in bone varies depending on the age and health of the individual.
* Bone is constantly being remodeled, with new bone being laid down and old bone being resorbed. This process helps to maintain the strength and integrity of bone.",7871,"62% inorganic, 38% organic",FALSE,medium
